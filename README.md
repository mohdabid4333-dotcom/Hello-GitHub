# Hello-GitHub
Welcome to hello-GitHub 👋   This is my very first GitHub project — a simple starting point to explore version control, commits, and collaboration.   It’s a space to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer. 🚀    Goals: - Practice using Git and GitHub basics - Share my journey into coding - Build a foundation for future projects.
