# Hello-GitHub
Welcome to hello-GitHub 👋   This is my very first GitHub project — a simple starting point to explore version control, commits, and collaboration.
<br>
It’s a space to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer. 🚀
<br>
Goals: 
- Practice using Git and GitHub basics
- Share my journey into coding
- Build a foundation for future projects.
